# Unlike the Admin API, all resource ID's in the StoreFront API are base64 encoded.

# Storefront API GraphQL queries, or mutations requiring an ID, need that ID to be base-64 encoded.

# When using GraphQL to query a specific collection with the Admin API, your query would not use a base-64 encoded ID
# query getCollection{
#   node (id:"gid://shopify/Collection/1") {
#      ... on Collection {
#         id
#         handle
#      }
#    }
# }
#

# With the Storefront API, to retrieve the same collection as illustrated with the Admin API, the id needs to be base-64 encoded.
# Z2lkOi8vc2hvcGlmeS9Db2xsZWN0aW9uLzE= as seen below is gid://shopify/Collection/1 base-64 encoded.

# Modern program languages all support base-64 encoding and decoding of string.
query getCollection{
   node (id:"Z2lkOi8vc2hvcGlmeS9Db2xsZWN0aW9uLzE=") {
    ... on Collection {
