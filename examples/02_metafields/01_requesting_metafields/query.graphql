# Metafields allow merchants to store additional information for Shopify resources including:
# - Products
# - Collections
# - Customers
# - Blogs
# - Pages
# - Shop

# Unlike the Admin API, metafields must first be made visible to the Storefront API.
# To make metafields visible to the Storefront API use the Shopify Admin API mutation metafieldStorefrontVisibilityCreate.
# For more information on the metafieldStorefrontVisibilityCreate mutation consult the Shopify Admin API doc https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/graphql/reference/metafields/metafieldstorefrontvisibilitycreate

# For a complete Storefront API metafield reference please consult the metafield tutorial at
# https://shopify.dev/tutorials/retrieve-metafields-with-storefront-api#expose-metafields-to-the-storefront-api

# Once the metafield for the given resource has been made visible to the Storefront API, it can be queried from that resource.

# For the resource types listed above, both a single metafield, and paginated list can be queried.

# The following example queries the Shop resource for the first ten available metafields using the shop's MetafieldConnection
query getShopMetafields{
    shop {
			name
      metafields(first:10){
        pageInfo{
          hasNextPage
          hasPreviousPage
        }
        edges{
          cursor
          node{
            id
            namespace
            key
            valueType
            value
          }
        }
      }
		}
}
