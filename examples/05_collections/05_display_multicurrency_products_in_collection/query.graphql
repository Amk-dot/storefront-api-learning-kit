# This query is returning data from a single collection, specified by the handle.

# The data being returned in the product connection can be used to display a page of products with multicurrency pricing.

# Since products can contain multiple variants, we've asked the products connection to return price ranges.

# The 'presentmentPriceRanges' object returns prices in all currencies offered by the shop.
# Since shops can offer multiple different currencies, the `presentmentPriceRanges` object requires pagination
