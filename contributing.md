## Folder Structure

Each folder is prefixed with a sort key. 

Folder names are all lowercase, separated with underscores.

Each query is contained in a folder. Queries are named `query.graphql`. If a query requires variables, those are added with a file named `variables.json` which is placed in the query folder.
