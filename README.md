## About this repo

This repo contains example queries and that demonstrate how to use Shopify's [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api/getting-started). We recommended downloading the package from the releases section so that you have access to all queries in the [Insmonia](https://insomnia.rest/) http client. Insomnia is a desktop app which allows you to make API calls using a graphical interface, and provides features such as automatic schema fetching and autocomplete which are valuable when learning a new API.

## How to use this repo

Head over to the [releases] section to download the Insomnia package.

Import the package by clicking the menu in the top left of the Insomnia window, then click "Import/Export"
